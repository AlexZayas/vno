# vno is the first build tool for compild and bundling [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs) components in a [Deno](https://github.com/denoland) runtime environement

## Why we built it
- Vue is an approachable javascript framework with an exciting ecosystem with remarkable versatility. Deno is a runtime environment intent on improving the shortcomings of node.js. We wanted to be able to leverage the vue framework in a deno runtime environment, but could not find a tool that made this possible. So we decided to make it ourselves. 

## Parser

- VNO Parser parses Vue single file components for deno.

## Dist

- This mod.ts file will ultimately be what people import AS vno to have access to all of the methods we have built throughout the file structure.
